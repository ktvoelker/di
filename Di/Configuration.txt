Configuration File Format
=========================

Uppercase tokens are non-terminals; lowercase are literals.

[]
default-modes = NAME+

[mode NAME]
display-name = TEXT
hidden = BOOL
default = CLASS ARG*
# Dynamically look up the class and construct it using the args.
# Arg types needed so far are string and char.
# CLASS can also be the special keyword "macro".
KEY = (CLASS ARG* (; CLASS ARG*)* ;?)?

[mode-sets]
NAME = NAME+

[macros]
NAME = (CLASS ARG* (; CLASS ARG*)* ;?)?


Interesting Non-Terminals
-------------------------

# MOD will have "Mask" appended to it and then be treated
# as a name in Gdk.ModifierType.
# KEYBASE will be treated as a name in Gdk.Key.
KEY := MOD* KEYBASE
